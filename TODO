Features:
    ✔ Add supporting_labels field (vector) @done(24-05-31 11:12)
    # Vector of labels of instances on which the rule is built (i.e., those not covered by previous rules), and in
    # the constant model info, include a supp_labels field with the labels of the instances that, among these, are covered by the rule.
    ☐ Add predicted_labels field (perhaps)
    # Labels predicted by the model, but initially the supporting_labels are sufficient
    # to calculate various metrics

Test:
    ✔ Testing parser outcome @done(24-05-31 11:12)
    ✔ Correct supporting_labels @done(24-05-31 11:12)
    ✔ Correct info (consequent/rule) @done(24-05-31 11:12)
    # Distribution of covered examples for consequent
    # Distribution of examples on which the rule was built
    ✔ Testing parser error @done(24-05-31 11:12)
