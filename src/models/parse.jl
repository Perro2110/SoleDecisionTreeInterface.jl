#= ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Code purpose ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given a string "min[A189] <= 250", build the corresponding FeatCondition.

In the example:
1) feature          is      SingleAttributeMin(189)
2) metacondition    is      SoleModels.FeatMetaCondition(feature, >)
3) threshold        is      250

This can be done by integrating this code with SoleLogics parsing system:
    SoleLogics.parseformulatree(
        "min[189] <= 250 âˆ§ min[189] <= 250", proposition_parser = featcondbuilder);
    as you notice, featconbuilder is passed to parseformulatree to interpret
    each proposition found as Proposition{FeatCondition} instead of Proposition{String}.

#= ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Limitations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here are listed the current limitations in featcondbuilder: in other words,
the limitations that has to be considered when converting a string
shaped like "feature[attribute] operator threshold" into a FeatCondition.

- Legal features are only "min" and "max" (see _BASE_FEATURES).
- In "min[A189] <= 250", a space between "<=" and "250" is required:
    this is because otherwise we don't know when the operator string finishes;
    a solution could be to take a vector of legal operators from the user, and provide
    a default one.
- In "min[A189] <= 250", "min" has to be written exactly like this ("min  " is illegal).
- Features are always Type{Real}.
- Thresholds are always Type{Float64}.
