# SoleModels

Welcome to the documentation for [SoleModels](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleModels.jl), the
first ever framework for **symbolic learning**.
This package provides the basic structures for representing symbolic models
and data.
Note that it does not provide any implementation of symbolic learning algorithms.
At the current state,
[ModalDecisionTrees](https://github.com/aclai-lab/ModalDecisionTrees.jl) is
the only implemented algorithm that is Sole-compatible.
